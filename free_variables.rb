# variable defined in a parent 


# Lambdas are Rubyâ€™s version of anonymous functions found in other languages


# Whenever an inner lambda refers to a variable that is not declared within it, 
# but that variable is declared in the parent scope of that lambda, that is a free variable. 


## RULES FOR A CLOSURE
# * must be a function
# * its body references some variable is a parent scope
